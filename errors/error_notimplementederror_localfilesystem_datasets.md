## ❌ Error: `NotImplementedError` When Loading a Hugging Face Dataset

### 🔍 Problem

While trying to load the dataset `mlabonne/guanaco-llama2-1k` using the Hugging Face `datasets` library, I encountered the following error:

```
NotImplementedError: Loading a dataset cached in a LocalFileSystem is not supported.
```

This happened when running the following line of code:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("mlabonne/guanaco-llama2-1k", split="train")
```

### 💡 Cause

This error is thrown when the Hugging Face `datasets` library attempts to load a cached version of the dataset, but the local file system is not supported in the way it's being accessed — often due to an outdated version of the library.

### ✅ Solution

After some troubleshooting, I found that the issue was resolved by simply upgrading the `datasets` package to the latest version. Here’s what I did:

1. **Upgraded the library**:

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade datasets
   ```

2. **Restarted the runtime/environment** to ensure the upgraded version was loaded.

3. **Re-imported the `load_dataset` function**:

   ```python
   from datasets import load_dataset
   ```

4. **Re-ran the original code**, and it worked without any issues:

   ```python
   dataset = load_dataset("mlabonne/guanaco-llama2-1k", split="train")
   print(dataset)
   ```

### 🧠 Takeaway

Always ensure you're using the latest version of the `datasets` library when working with newer or community-contributed datasets. Outdated versions may not fully support all caching mechanisms or remote file systems used by newer datasets.
